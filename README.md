## Some Points to be Noted

- Solutions are shared with sole intention of knowledge sharing, it's upto the peers to ensure fair usage
- It's not guaranteed that all solutions are accepted solutions althought majority of them are
- In case you have question about some solution, reach out to author at sakibulmowla@gmail.com. [N.B. it's highly unlikely that author will be able to recall stuffs but worth a shot maybe? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯]
